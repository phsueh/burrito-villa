This is Burrito Villa! A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Approach and reflections

I choose Next.js because I felt it was easier to use a framework that included front-end, back-end, and database capabilites. 

However, I quickly learned that easier is not guaranteed no matter how much "convenience" the framework offers. I ran into unfamiliar concepts and learned a lot, but fell short of implementing all the features. Before this challenge, I developed APIs and backend applications using Sequelize, Ruby on Rails, and Spring Boot. This challenge gave me a chance to see areas of improvement when spinning up an new application quickly.

Thanks for reading!

## Getting Started

This project uses Prisma and Postgres. Both front-end and back-end are deployed on Vercel.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Second, download dependencies
